# 60 Days of Flutter: Starting Over, Building Strong

If I had to start over learning Flutter, I would begin like this.

This repository documents my 60-day journey of relearning Flutter from scratchâ€”this time with the aim of mastering it. Iâ€™ve explored Flutter before, but now Iâ€™m committing to building a stronger foundation and pushing myself toward advanced concepts like animations, state management, RESTful integration, and performance optimization.

Every day for the next 60 days, I will be:

- Reviewing fundamentals and best practices
- Building small to mid-scale Flutter projects
- Writing notes on what I learn and how I solve problems
- Tracking my progress toward becoming a confident Flutter developer

This is my commitment to stay consistent, build real projects, and finally feel at home with Flutter.
