## Getter and Setter in Dart

In Dart, getter and setter methods allow you to control the access and modification of private variables. 

### Key Points:
- **Getter**: Used to retrieve the value of a private field.
- **Setter**: Used to set a value to a private field, with validation if needed.


### Benefits:
- Encapsulation: Private fields are protected.

- Validation: You can add logic to control the values being set.

- Readability: Getters and setters make code more readable and cleaner.

### When to use Getters and Setters?
1. Control: When you want to control how a field is accessed or modified.

2. Validation: When you need to add rules or logic before assigning values.
